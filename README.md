# Aviator-*native*

Why -native? the expo version was a disaster.

## What is this app for?

Just a simple thing to log your flights and see them on an interactive map!!!

## How to run it?

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/espcaa/aviator-native/releases/)
2. Download the latest .apk file
3. Install it & enjoy!!!

## Wait there's login and stuff uhhh

I don't really know why i added this but uh it's fine, cloud sync and stuff. I only log emails and hashed passswords because i need them for you to log in :)

## What i used?

- A lot of android stuff
- Bun for the backend (_that you can see here: [aviator-backend](https://github.com/espcaa/aviator-backend)_)
- React Native (tried but not anymore, see my first attempt [here](https://github.com/espcaa/aviator))
- Mapbox for the shiny map!
- Supabase for the db, but migrating soon to a local postgres
- Sqlites for the airlines/airport data!

## How to contribute?

uh if you're crazy enough to try, just make a Pr!
